            <h2>What does it mean to live an eco-friendly lifestyle? </h2>

            <h2>Why would someone want to live an eco-friendly lifestyle?</h2>
            There are many benefits to striving to live more environmentally friendly. For example, it can
            be more cost efficent, build a better community, promote a healthier lifestyle, and help raise awareness
            for future generations to come (Campbell).
