            <h2> How does recycling work? </h2>
            <p> 
                We are all well aquainted with the reycling symbol, but what do those 3 arrows really represent? Here are the steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li> Collection and processing: This is your part, where you drop off your recycable materials! After being collected, recyclables are sent to a 
                            facility to be sorted, cleaned, and processed into matierals that can be used to manufacture new products.
                        </li>
                        <li> Manufacturing: Properly processed materials are then distributed to manufacturing companies where they are used to 
                            create new products. There are several household objects that do contain recycled materials like paper towls, 
                            plastic containers, and steel cans. 
                        </li>
                        <li> Purchasing: This is your part as well! You can buy new products made with recycled material, or choose to buy
                            products that can be recycled - whether the product itself or the packaging it came in. Look for the recycling logo or 
                            any labels that inform you on if it is recyclable or made from recyclable materials. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>

        <section id="what">
            <h2> What is recyclable? </h2>
            <p> There are quite a lot of items you can recycle if you know how to! We often think of the issued recycle bins, but those have limited
                materials we can recycle. Specialized recycle centers offer a much larger varitey on what you can recycle. Common household objects that can be 
                recycled include:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Batteries </li>
                        <li> Plastics </li>
                        <li> Glass </li>
                        <li> Used Oil </li>
                        <li> Tires </li>
                    </ul>
