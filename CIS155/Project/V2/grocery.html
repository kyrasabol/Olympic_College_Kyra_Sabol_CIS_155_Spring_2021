            <p> Grocery stores can be the place to accumalte more plastic than you need, but it doesn't have to be! You 
                can shop more sustainably at the grocery store. Here are some tips.
            </p>

            <h2> Buying in Bulk </h2>
            <p> Bulk items require less packaging, sometimes none at all if you use your own jars and bags! Items that are easily 
                stored in your cabinets like pastas, oats, and nuts have a longer shelf life and are easily found in bulk. Supermarkets 
                usually do have isles where you can easily access bulk items, but do some research for some zero-waste stores in your area
                for a bigger variety of products
            </p>

            <h2> No More Single-Use </h2>
            <p> Items in prepackaged wrappers or containers are easy for on the go, but these single-use plastics and styrofoam ultimately
                do more harm to the environment than good to us. Look for recyclable packaging such as cardboard, organic fabrics, or cornstarch. 
                Instead of relying on the store-provided plastic bags, bring some of your own, reusable bags. Invest in some produce
                bags as well - these will help protect your produce and the planet. 
            </p>

            <h2> Go Local </h2>
            <p> If you want fresh and eco-friendly, conisder a trip to your local's farmers market. Not only will you know where and how 
                your produce was grown, but you also help support the community. Sometimes you don't even have to seek out the local produce in markets,
                the local grocery store may feature where the produce you buy is from. 
            </p>

            <h2> Compost </h2>
            <p> One of the best ways to reduce food waste at home is to compost! It isn't easy to compost if you live in an apartment complex,
                but if you are determined enough, it can work out. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1i2KOKITmI">See how this woman composts</a> in her tiny German apartment. If you're ready but unsure how 
                to get started, <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/packages/help-around-the-kitchen/how-to-compost">follow this link for a beginner's guide.</a>
